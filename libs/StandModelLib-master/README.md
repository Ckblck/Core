## Website Model Creator
Supports models generated from https://mrgarretto.com/armorstand/ <b>version 1.12</b> only. However, I see no reason why it would be tied to any specific Minecraft version. The limitation is with the mrgarretto command string & materials parser and and not with Spigot versions.

**Important Note:** When using the website - The following limitations apply:
* You may and only use "Medium" or "Large" pieces. That means NO part can be "Small" or "Solid" otherwise it will break.
* The command must be generated using the "Single" option.
* When loading from a config, ensure the command is on the same line and encapsulated in ' '
* Models must be centered on the website before being generated. Otherwise they will not spawn in centered.

## Features
* Ability to parse model creation commands (that normally go into command blocks) from v1.12 https://mrgarretto.com/armorstand/
* Model rotation around central position
* Highly Optimised:
  *  Render distance to remove un-needed ArmorStands
  *  Animation distance to only display animations when a player is near-by
  *  Player being within Render or Animation distance is updated asynchronous
* Custom Model Interaction event
